# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code and its solution.

## The Bug
The `fetchData` function fetches data from a remote server.  While it includes a `try-catch` block to handle errors, it lacks proper error handling or logging in the production environment which may lead to unexpected crashes. 

## The Solution
The solution enhances the error handling by providing more detailed error messages and logging mechanisms. It utilizes a custom exception class for improved error identification and management, thereby ensuring better application stability and debugging.
